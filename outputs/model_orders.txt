SARIMA Orders (used in forecasting via config.yaml)
================================================

DE: order=(2, 0, 1), seasonal_order=(1, 1, 1, 24)
FR: order=(2, 0, 2), seasonal_order=(1, 1, 1, 24)
ES: order=(1, 0, 2), seasonal_order=(1, 1, 1, 24)

Note: These orders were selected via BIC grid search during
the decomposition phase (decompose_acf_pacf.py) and stored
in config.yaml for use by forecast.py.
